Omniflow.fi
Work in Progress â€“ Omnichain Decentralized Exchange for the Ethereum Ecosystem

Omniflow.fi is an open-source, omnichain decentralized exchange (DEX) designed to enable seamless trading of assets across multiple Ethereum-based Layer 1 and Layer 2 networks.
Leveraging LayerZero's cross-chain messaging, Omniflow aims to abstract away the complexities of bridging and offer a truly unified trading experience.

Project Status: In active development (Q2 2025)

Vision
We believe that the future of decentralized finance is omnichain.
Omniflow's goal is to allow users to trade across Ethereum, Optimism, Arbitrum, Base, and other Ethereum-aligned networks as easily as they currently trade on a single chain.

Core principles:

Open-source and fully transparent development

Permissionless access for anyone, anywhere

Non-custodial and trust-minimized architecture

Maximizing the composability of Ethereum and its scaling ecosystem

Current Progress

Component	              Status	            Notes
Smart contracts	        In progress	        Core DEX and liquidity pool contracts
Cross-chain messaging	  Prototype	          LayerZero integration underway
Frontend application	  In progress	        Built with Next.js and Wagmi
Testnet deployment	    Upcoming	          Targeting Sepolia, Arbitrum Sepolia, Optimism Sepolia


Why It Matters
Omniflow.fi is aligned with the Ethereum ethos:

Public good: The project will be released under a permissive open-source license (MIT).

Permissionless innovation: No privileged actors; anyone can use, deploy, or integrate.

Ethereum alignment: Focused primarily on Ethereum L1 and rollups.

Accessibility: Simplifying cross-chain interactions to onboard a broader range of users.

By improving omnichain trading UX and liquidity, Omniflow contributes to strengthening the modular Ethereum ecosystem.

Roadmap
Q2 2025:

Complete initial smart contract development

Launch prototype on public testnets

Begin frontend user testing

Initiate external code review (pre-audit)

Q3 2025:

Public testnet with liquidity mining incentives

Security audit and formal verification

Mainnet deployment on selected chains

Open governance mechanisms (optional)

Request for Support
We are seeking a small grant to:

Support continued smart contract development

Cover testnet deployment and infrastructure costs

Accelerate community outreach and documentation efforts

Funding from the Ethereum Foundation would directly contribute to the growth of open, omnichain infrastructure built for and within the Ethereum ecosystem.
